This is because mustelids are my favorite taxon. I would have included my second-favorite taxon, pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walruses), however I discovered there are none in any of the listed parks. The only conclusion I draw from this is that more people should visit Alaskan national parks.\n\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   ParkName              count\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Glacier                   9\n 2 Grand Teton               9\n 3 Yellowstone               8\n 4 Yosemite                  8\n 5 Acadia                    7\n 6 Great Smoky Mountains     7\n 7 Olympic                   7\n 8 Rocky Mountain            7\n 9 Indiana Dunes             6\n10 Cuyahoga Valley           5\n11 Grand Canyon              4\n12 Bryce Canyon              3\n13 Hot Springs               3\n14 Zion                      3\n15 Joshua Tree               2"
