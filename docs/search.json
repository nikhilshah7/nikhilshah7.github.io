This is because mustelids are my favorite taxon. I would have included my second-favorite taxon, pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walruses), however I discovered there are none in any of the listed parks. The only conclusion I draw from this is that more people should visit Alaskan national parks.\n\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   ParkName              count\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Glacier                   9\n 2 Grand Teton               9\n 3 Yellowstone               8\n 4 Yosemite                  8\n 5 Acadia                    7\n 6 Great Smoky Mountains     7\n 7 Olympic                   7\n 8 Rocky Mountain            7\n 9 Indiana Dunes             6\n10 Cuyahoga Valley           5\n11 Grand Canyon              4\n12 Bryce Canyon              3\n13 Hot Springs               3\n14 Zion                      3\n15 Joshua Tree               2"

This shows how many words follow those structures.\n\npalindromes &lt;- palindromes |&gt;\n  mutate(suffix = ifelse(str_detect(word, \"\\\\b(de|re|ro|s)\\\\w+(ed|er|or|s)\\\\b\"), 'Yes', 'No'))\n\npalindromes |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(fill = suffix, x = length)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Word Length',\n    y = '# of Palindromes',\n    title = 'Single-Word Palindromes in English'\n  )\n\nThere are only 118 palindromes in this dataset. Of these, there’s only one palindrome longer than seven letters, and 29 are only palindromes because of a suffix, and the root word wouldn’t be one at all. In total, there are about 30 of them that you might encounter in your day-to-day life, which is only 1% of 1% of the words in English. I hear about palindromes constantly, but it turns out most of them are actually just engineered phrases like “race car” or “a man, a plan, a canal, panama”.\nI think it’s interesting how there seems to be some kind of inclination towards odd-length words, that have a unique letter in the middle, like “civic” or “refer” or “tenet”.\n\nwords_filtered |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = length)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Word Length',\n    y = '# of Words',\n    title = 'Length of English Words'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tend to think of a syllable as a pair of a consonant sound and a vowel sound, and it looks like there’s a slight amount more of even-length words than odd in English, so I’m a bit surprised to see such a preference for odd-length ones out of the palindromes.\n\n\nAnti-Palindromes, or Reduplications\nWhile trying to work out a way to find palindromes with stringr functions (apparently R does not have reverse indexing like Python does so this is either not possible or very convoluted) I accidentally came up with a list of “anti-palindromes”, where the back half of the word is also the front half of the word. If “toot” is a palindrome, “toto” is an anti-palindrome.\n\nreduplications &lt;- words_filtered |&gt; \n  filter(str_sub(word, 1, floor(str_length(word)/2)) == str_sub(word, -ceiling(str_length(word)/2), -1))\n\nwords_letters &lt;- words_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(start) |&gt;\n  summarize(count_total = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(\"All English Words\" = count_total/sum(count_total)*100)\n\nreduplication_letters &lt;- reduplications |&gt;\n  group_by(start) |&gt;\n  summarize(count_red = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(\"Anti-Palindromes\" = count_red/sum(count_red)*100)\n\nletters &lt;- words_letters |&gt;\n  left_join(reduplication_letters)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(start)`\n\nletters_long &lt;- letters |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"All English Words\", \"Anti-Palindromes\"), names_to = 'dictionary', values_to = 'percent') \n\nletters_long |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(fill = dictionary, x = start, y = percent)) +\n  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Letter',\n    y = 'Frequency (%)',\n    title = 'Starting Letters of Anti-Palindromes'\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, a lot of these anti-palindromes, or reduplications, start with uncommon letters. This could because many of those letters are emphatic consonant sounds that sound more interesting when repeated. Examples include beriberi, yoyo, and pompom."
